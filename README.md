# **gorilla-mux-gorm-books-api**

Welcome to the gorilla-mux-gorm-books-api project, a simple bookstore API built with Go, gorilla/mux, and GORM.

## **Overview**

This project provides a straightforward API for managing books within a bookstore. It utilizes gorilla/mux for routing HTTP requests and GORM as the ORM for interacting with a MySQL database.

## **Technologies Used**

#### **Go (Golang):**

The backend is developed in Go, leveraging its performance, concurrency, and simplicity.

#### **Gorilla/Mux:**

Gorilla/mux is a powerful HTTP router and dispatcher for Go, allowing for flexible route matching and easy handling of HTTP requests.

#### **GORM:**

GORM is an ORM library for Go, providing a convenient way to interact with databases. It simplifies database operations and offers features like automatic table creation, querying, and data manipulation.

#### **MySQL:**

MySQL is used as the backend database to store book information.

#### **Dynamic Backend:**

Utilizing Go with gorilla/mux and GORM, the backend efficiently handles HTTP requests and database interactions.

#### **Dependency Management:**

Go Modules are used for dependency management, ensuring consistent and reliable project dependencies.

#### **Monitoring and Logging:**

Error handling is present in the code, with appropriate logging for troubleshooting and maintenance purposes.

#### **RESTful API:**

This project extensively employs RESTful APIs to provide access to bookstore functionalities. These APIs meticulously define endpoints, specify request/response formats, and outline any authentication requirements necessary for accessing the bookstore's resources.
